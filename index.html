    <h1>Hello World.</h1>
    <p>My name is Spencer James.</p>
    <p>I'm currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
    <p>In March 2017 I completed my MS in<a href="www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington. While in school, I developed an interest in creative coding.</p>
    <p>I've been learning <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. Here are some cool things I made:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="split_squares.html">Split Squares</a></li>
            <li><a href="ball_droppa.html">Ball Droppa</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
