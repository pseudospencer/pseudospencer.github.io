                    <p>This project is a tribute page to my dog that passed away recently. I designed the page using Figma before I coded it up.

                    <p>This project is a quick survey form about music preferences. Through working on this project, I gained practice using different types of input fields and with HTML5 form validation. I also practiced creating a full-featured mobile friendly design. Creating this page was a bit of a challenge for me because I didn't stop to consider the final layout before building the site. As a result, I had to go back and restructure the HTML in a way that facilitated a clean layout. <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/" target="_blank">Project requirements here</a></p>

                    <p>This webpage is a landing page for the OP-1 synthesizer by Teenage Engineering. I pulled a lot of the copy for the page from the Guitar Center and Sweetwater websites. For this page, I was focused on creating a clean design that showed off the device, with calls to action to encourage checkout. Figuring out how to create a responsive video frame was a bit tricky. <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/" target="_blank">Project requirements here</a></p>

                    <p>For the technical documentation page, I decided to create a quick introduction to p5.js. While working on this project, I had fun creating a pastel color scheme after realizing that the colors I'd chosen initially clashed horribly. I also enjoyed leveraging some of my previous knowledge of p5.js to include multuple p5 sketches in the page as working demonstrations. I always feel that with docs such as these, it's great to see a working example along with the code. I'm not sure this tutorial is that helpful however - the real p5 docs are much better. Regardless, this was a great way to practice working with preformatted text, and to create a page for information consumption. <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/" target="_blank">Project requirements here</a></p>

                    <p>The final project for the Responsive Web Development certification was to create this portfolio page! I used flexbox, some sweet gradients, and everything I'd practiced up to this point to get it done. Honestly, this was probably the most fun of the five because it was completely up to me! <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage" target="_blank">Project requirements here</a></p>
